                This week was packed with meaningful progress building for a new experiment, continue with infrastructure cleanup, and celebrating the launch of Buffer's AI Assistant. So proud of what the team built 👏
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                🧪 Prepared a new experiment launching Monday: Built new upgrade modal and repositioned CTAs across one area of the product. Excited to see how new users respond to this next week.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                ✨ Small wins that matter: Fixed a bug in the collapsible sidebar, added a loading skeleton for the app menu.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                💭 Monthly reflections: Had my monthly check-in with my manager. These sessions always help me zoom out and see the bigger picture beyond the code.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                🏗️ Infrastructure cleanup continues: After last week's refactor, we're slowly removing the unnecessary complexity from our stack. Less moving parts = easier maintenance.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                🔥 Caused a major incident: My SQS queue refactor took down password reset emails. One revert later, we're stable. Lesson learned: canary releases > big bang changes. The team's quick response was incredible.

              <p class="update-content">
                Despite it being a shorter week with Monday's bank holiday and juggling work while one of my kids was home sick 🤒, I'm grateful for the meaningful progress we made.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                🏗️ Infrastructure modernization: Led a major cleanup effort removing legacy webworkers across our platform, reducing technical debt and simplifying our architecture for better maintainability.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                🔒 Security & code quality: Addressed the last bits of a security vulnerability in our dependencies, refined error handling, and removed redundant code paths—making our platform more secure, stable, and easier to maintain.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                ✨ Smarter scheduling: Enhanced our Best Time to Post algorithm to avoiding conflicts with already scheduled content, giving users better recommendations.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                🚀 Collaborative QA: Worked with the team to thoroughly test a new feature that's launching next week—excited to see it in our users' hands!
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                Beyond code, I also spent time giving peer feedback to teammates: this is an important part of building a strong engineering culture at Buffer 🤗

                Every week I'll be sharing what I'm building at Buffer. The wins, the bugs, the security patches nobody sees. Real engineering work, unfiltered.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                🌚 Dark Mode: Mission Accomplished 🎃 This week was all about the polish—fixed those pesky images and elements that weren't playing nice in dark mode, cleaned up some styling rough edges, and is finally here: Dark mode is officially "just mode" now.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                🎨 Making Buffer prettier, one illustration at a time: Rolled out custom illustrations across login, empty states, and upgrade paths. Out with the generic stock art, in with designs that actually feel like Buffer. Bonus: they look great in both light AND dark mode.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                ⬆️⬇️ The Queue is getting smarter: Ever wanted to instantly move a post to the top or bottom of your queue? We're testing this internally right now! Added a reorder menu and can't wait to test this out more broadly.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                📟 This week I'm On-call 🚨: So between shipping features, I'm also troubleshooting a few production hiccups. It's all part of the job—you learn the system deeply when you're the one keeping it running.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                🔒 The not-so-glamorous (but important): Patched an Axios vulnerability. Added PostHog integration for Session Replays. We are going to be trialing this out.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                Building in public means sharing the whole picture—the flashy features AND the security patches that nobody sees but everyone needs.
